Here is a brief explanation of the code base:

--> Paraphraseproblem - a class which represents each problem, two sentences and a label

--> Evaluation - contains evaluation methods which includes helpers which update scores, calculate different metrics

--> Features - a class which computes all the features for the problem

--> IOs - helper class for IO methods and other helpers

--> Label - labels from the amazon turkers

--> Params - the directory that contains links to the various directories that contain the data

--> Phrase - a class that contains representations for the twitter data in train file

--> Sentence - a class that models each sentence

--> stops.txt - a list of all stops

--> scripts
		--> run - script to run the evaluation, note it works only in the javanlp repo on the NLP clusters
		--> some more scripts for processing data


Note: All experiments were run on the NLP clusters.
Note: All code above was written in collaboration with Xiao Cheng, PhD student, Stanford NLP group
